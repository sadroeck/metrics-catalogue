Metrics Catalogue Macros
=============

This library provides a set of declarative macros to automatically derive a catalogue of [metrics](https://github.com/metrics-rs/metrics) from a struct definition.
These macros make up the core of the [metrics-catalogue](https://github.com/sadroeck/metrics-catalogue) crate.

```toml
[dependencies]
metrics-catalogue-macros = "0.1"
```
